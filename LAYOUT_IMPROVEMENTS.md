# Layout Improvements Summary

## Overview
Reduced the use of expanders throughout the application and replaced them with better Streamlit layout alternatives based on the latest API best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Always-Expanded Expanders with Containers
**Before:** Used `st.expander(expanded=True)` for content that was always visible
**After:** Used `st.container(border=True)` for better visual separation

**Affected Sections:**
- ⚙️ Laser Settings
- 📈 Cross-sections Overview  
- 🔬 Tissue Penetration

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner UI without unnecessary expand/collapse functionality
- Better visual hierarchy with bordered containers
- Improved performance (no expand/collapse state management)

### 2. Replaced Collapsed Expanders with Containers
**Before:** Used `st.expander(expanded=False)` for secondary content
**After:** Used `st.container(border=True)` for consistent visual treatment

**Affected Sections:**
- 📊 Global Wavelength Parameters

**Benefits:**
- All content is immediately visible and accessible
- Better user experience - no need to hunt for hidden controls
- Consistent visual design across the application

### 3. Consolidated Related Settings with Tabs
**Before:** Separate sections with individual expanders for:
- 🔬 General Settings
- 💧 Water Absorption Settings  
- 🌊 Light Scattering Settings

**After:** Single "Tissue Parameters" section with organized tabs:
- 🔬 General Settings
- 💧 Absorption Properties
- 🌊 Scattering Properties

**Benefits:**
- Better organization of related functionality
- Reduced vertical scrolling
- Cleaner navigation structure
- More intuitive grouping of tissue-related parameters

### 4. Updated Navigation
**Before:** 8 navigation items including separate absorption and scattering sections
**After:** 6 navigation items with consolidated tissue parameters

**Benefits:**
- Simplified navigation bar
- Better focus on main functional areas
- Reduced cognitive load for users

## Streamlit API Best Practices Applied

### Containers (`st.container`)
- Used for grouping related content with visual separation
- Added borders for better visual hierarchy
- Replaced always-expanded expanders

### Tabs (`st.tabs`)
- Used for organizing related settings into logical groups
- Better than multiple expanders for related functionality
- Maintains clean vertical layout

### Columns (`st.columns`)
- Continued use of columns for horizontal layout of controls
- Maintains responsive design

### Popovers (`st.popover`)
- Kept for appropriate use cases (marker settings)
- Good for secondary/optional controls that don't need constant visibility

## Performance Improvements
- Reduced DOM complexity by removing unnecessary expander elements
- Eliminated expand/collapse state management overhead
- Faster rendering with direct container usage

## User Experience Improvements
- All controls are immediately visible and accessible
- Better visual hierarchy with consistent container borders
- More intuitive organization with logical grouping in tabs
- Reduced need for expand/collapse interactions
- Cleaner, more modern interface design

## Code Maintainability
- Simplified component structure
- Reduced conditional rendering logic
- More consistent layout patterns
- Better separation of concerns with tab organization
