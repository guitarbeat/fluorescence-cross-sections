# Bug Fix Summary

## Issue: NameError: name 'main' is not defined

### Problem
When converting from single-page to multi-page architecture, some page files retained leftover `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` calls without the corresponding `main()` function definitions.

### Root Cause
During the refactoring process, the `main()` function definitions were removed from page files (since pages in `st.navigation` execute directly), but some `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` calls were not properly cleaned up.

### Files Affected
- `pages/tissue_parameters.py` - Line 120
- `pages/fluorophore_library.py` - End of file

### Solution Applied
Removed all remaining `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` calls from page files since:

1. **Pages in `st.navigation` execute directly** - No need for main() function wrappers
2. **Code runs top-to-bottom** - Streamlit pages execute their content immediately
3. **Cleaner architecture** - Direct execution is simpler and more maintainable

### Files Fixed
```python
# BEFORE (causing NameError)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # main() function doesn't exist

# AFTER (clean execution)
# Code executes directly - no wrapper needed
```

### Verification
- ✅ All `main()` calls removed from page files
- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ Navigation works correctly
- ✅ All pages load without errors

### Prevention
In the new multi-page architecture:
- Page files should execute content directly
- No need for `main()` function wrappers
- Use `if __name__ == "__main__":` only for testing individual pages

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The application now runs successfully with the modern `st.navigation` architecture.
